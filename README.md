# Museum of Candy

This is a webpage for a fictional museum of candy. It was coded using semantic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Bootstrap** with some **JavaScript** added for scroll animation. It is a responsive website and adapts to all screen sizes.

This is one of the projects included in Colt Steele's _Web Developer Bootcamp 2021_ course.
